 - a comment is unnecessary if the code explain itself 
 - make longer variables and methods which are easy understandable
 - if you are not sure in your code than there could be a problem in your code
 - dont use abbreviation to not cause confusion
 - try to explain idiomatic methods and variables in simple words
 - if it is necessary provide links to part of the source code or external links 
for further information
 - explain in comments fixing a bug
 - use TODOs with comments to point incomplete source code
